Hi! In case you never used URP before there or see pink or green materials this is simple steps to get all up and running.

1.Go to Edit-->Projects Setings-->Graphics

2.Click dot right to the Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings field
 and select UniversalRenderPipelineAsset from the list.

3.Go to Edit-->Player-->Other settings
And set Color space from gamma to Linear.

Done !
